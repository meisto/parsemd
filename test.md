# An h1 header *extra italic*

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, ***bolditalic***. Itemized lists
look like:

  - this **one**
  - that one
  - the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are

> They can span **multiple** paragraphs,
> if you like.
> Block quotes can also be very loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong.

Use 3 dashes for an *em-dash*. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:
